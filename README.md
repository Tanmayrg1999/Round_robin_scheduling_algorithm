# Round_robin_scheduling_algorithm
In Round-robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limited time slice. The code asks the user to enter the total number of processes and the corresponding arrival and burst time associated with the process. Also it takes the time slice or the time quantum as the input from the user.
